 * It may take a minute or so at first launch to get the desktop to present. This is normal at first log in.
 * Mozilla Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer have all been tested; Google Chrome has been tested but is buggy.
 * Once this is completed, go to the terminal and you should be ready to start with the Azure CLI instructions below.

3. <strong>Install Azure CLI (AZ CLI) on your workstation</strong>

 * Azure CLI is available for Mac, Windows and Linux.
 * You will need administrator access to install Azure CLI. You can switch user to root with ``su - root``. The password is the same as you used to login to the VNC environment.
 * You can find installation instructions here: [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-yum?view=azure-cli-latest)
 * It is recommended you open reference material like the Azure CLI reference within your VNC environment so you can easily copy/paste commands.

4. <strong>Log in to your Azure account via the CLI</strong>

 * Use ``az login`` to login to your Azure Account.
 * If a new Firefox window does not appear, please visit ``http://microsoft.com/devicelogin`` and use the provided code to authenticate.
 * On your desktop, open the credentials.txt file to obtain the list of credentials which have been assigned to you.

 * After logging in, your terminal window will update with the JSON output of your subscription confirming the login was successful
 * If you wish, you may use the ``az configure`` command to change your default output to <strong>3 - Table</strong> format
